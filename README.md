# Week-1-Homework
<Code Refactor>

- The motivation behind this project was to refactor the existing code into a more consumable and structured format. 
- Semantic HTML Elements were added with comments to better identify each section when reading the code. 
- The CSS was modified to consolidate some of the repettive actions. 
- Font size, background color, and image descriptions were added/modified to bring the Accessibility of the page up. 
- In this project I gained a much better grasp of how to properly structure HTML and utilize the various tags, classes, and IDs in my CSS file.
